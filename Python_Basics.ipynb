        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "   - Python is a programming Language used for Data Science, Web Development, Game Development, etc.\n",
        "   It is popular due it its nature of simplicity, versatality, easy to learn language. It also has large number of libraries like Pandas and Numpy.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "   - A Python interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line, translating it into instructions the computer can understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "   - Pre-defined keywords are predefined reserved words with special meanings so the interpreter can understand them. They perform specific tasks in Python programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "   - No, Python keywords cannot be used as variable names.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "   - Mutability in Python means when an object can be changed by its value or state after it has been created.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "   - Lists are mutable for flexibility, updation and alteration of data whereas tuples are immutable to ensure safety and efficiency, or to represent a constant data.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "   - \"==\" checks if values are equal i.e., the contents of the objects are the same\n",
        "   Whereas,\n",
        "   \"is\" checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory. \"is\" is also a identity operator.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, logical operators are used to combine conditional statements and perform logical operations. These operators allow you to perform Boolean logic i.e., operations that result in True or False. The main logical operators in Python are:\n",
        "\n",
        "  \"AND\" opeartor: Returns True if both conditions are true.\n",
        "\n",
        "  \"OR\" operator: Returns True if at least one condition is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "  \"NOT\" operator: Reverses the truth value of a condition i.e., True becomes False, False becomes True.    \n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "   - Type casting is a process of changing datatype of a value or object. It is done to execute operations using operators when the data type is mismatched.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "    - Implicit type casting happens automatically when Python can safely promote a smaller type to a larger type\n",
        "\n",
        "      For example:                      \n",
        "      a = 10  #integer\n",
        "\n",
        "      b = 5.5  #float\n",
        "\n",
        "     result = a + b  # a is automatically converted to float for the addition\n",
        "\n",
        "     print(result)  # Output: 15.5 (float)\n",
        "     \n",
        "     Explicit casting happens when the programmer specifies how to convert one type to another               \n",
        "     For example:\n",
        "     a = 10.5  # float\n",
        "\n",
        "     b = int(a)  # manually convert float to int\n",
        "\n",
        "     print(b)  # Output: 10 (note: truncation of decimal part)\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "    - Conditional statements allows or enables the program to make decisions based on certain criteria or conditions. It helps in analysing whether the condition is true or false\n",
        "\n",
        "12.  How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "   - The elif statement is checked only if the preceding if or elif conditions are False.\n",
        "\n",
        "        If an elif condition is True, the associated block of code is executed, and Python will skip the remaining elif and else blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "        If none of the if or elif conditions are True, the program will execute the code inside the else block (if provided).  \n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "    - for loop is used when you want to iterate over a sequence (like a list, string, or range) or when the number of iterations is known.\n",
        "\n",
        "     while loop is when you want to repeat a block of code as long as a condition is True.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "    - A while loop is more suitable than a for loop when the number of iterations is not known in advance, and the loop should continue running as long as a certain condition is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Scenario: User Input Validation\n",
        "\n",
        "     A scenario where a program needs to continuously prompt the user for their password until they enter the correct one. In this case, you don’t know how many attempts the user will need to make, so a while loop is a better fit.\n",
        "      \n",
        "     The program will keep asking the user to enter a password.\n",
        "\n",
        "     It will only stop asking when the correct password is entered.\n",
        "\n",
        "     If the user keeps entering the wrong password, the program will keep asking indefinitely (or until the correct password is entered).\n",
        "     \n",
        "                        \n",
